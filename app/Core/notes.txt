- try to infer nb_features, nb_classes from model - if cannot then should ask the user.
- attack/defense parameters in config are single value, should be arrays - to run fine tuning loops
- art.metrics.verification_decision_trees, what is that and can it help us?
- implement wrapper like from the blackbox comparisons project
- clip values - important to set them when wrapping in art classifier, ask the user or infer from data?
- consistent schema to how we recieve x_test and y_test, one-hot encoded ? shapes? rgb/greyscale?
- defense instances VS as parameter to art estimator wrapper ?
- create fine-tuning loop for attack parameter
- metrics by class uses classification_report which does not provide all metrices possible, need to extend it
- evasion.targeted_universal_pertubation - check how it works, possible simba and fgsm on xgboost?
- dealing with large number of samples - batches, multithreading
- reference paper found in ART about general evaluation of robustness : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06705.pdf
